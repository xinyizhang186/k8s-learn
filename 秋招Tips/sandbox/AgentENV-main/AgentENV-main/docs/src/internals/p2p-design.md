# P2P Artifact Transport

AgentENV has a project-wide P2P artifact transport layer in `src/p2p/`. It lets runtime modules publish, discover, and fetch validated files from peer nodes without depending on a concrete transport implementation.

The first concrete backend is embedded in the AgentENV server process and uses `iroh` plus `iroh-blobs`. The public API stays behind traits and serializable types so future backends can be selected by configuration.

## Goals

- Provide one reusable node-to-node artifact transport for multiple AgentENV modules.
- Keep module code independent from concrete backends.
- Use scheduler for endpoint discovery and a lightweight in-memory artifact-to-node index, not artifact metadata storage or data proxying.
- Let transport backends use their native content-addressing or integrity checks while keeping module code backend-neutral.
- Keep disabled mode cheap and safe for single-node deployments.

## Module Layout

| Path | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| `src/p2p/mod.rs` | Public exports and `transport_from_config` factory |
| `src/p2p/config.rs` | Resolved P2P config and transport kind selection |
| `src/p2p/types.rs` | Transport-neutral artifact, endpoint, peer, and publish types |
| `src/p2p/transport.rs` | `P2pTransport` trait and disabled implementation |
| `src/p2p/discovery/` | Peer discovery and artifact-index hints via scheduler/static/no-op implementations |
| `src/p2p/iroh/` | Embedded `iroh` + `iroh-blobs` backend and catalog protocol |

## Public API

Consumers use `Arc<dyn P2pTransport>`:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait P2pTransport: Send + Sync {
    async fn lookup(&self, key: &P2pArtifactKey) -> Result<Option<P2pArtifactDescriptor>>;
    async fn lookup_with_hints(
        &self,
        key: &P2pArtifactKey,
        hints: &[P2pArtifactProviderHint],
    ) -> Result<Option<P2pArtifactDescriptor>>;
    async fn fetch(&self, descriptor: &P2pArtifactDescriptor, destination: &Path) -> Result<u64>;
    async fn fetch_bytes(&self, descriptor: &P2pArtifactDescriptor) -> Result<Bytes>;
    async fn fetch_byte_range(
        &self,
        descriptor: &P2pArtifactDescriptor,
        offset: u64,
        len: usize,
    ) -> Result<Bytes>;
    async fn publish(&self, request: &P2pPublishRequest) -> Result<()>;
    async fn unpublish(&self, key: &P2pArtifactKey) -> Result<bool>;
    fn local_endpoint(&self) -> Option<P2pEndpoint>;
    async fn shutdown(&self) -> Result<()>;
}
```

`P2pArtifactKey` is a stable string chosen by the consuming module. One key represents one logical artifact. Callers should encode the complete cache context into that key and use descriptor metadata for module-specific validation.

`P2pArtifactDescriptor` contains:

- `key`: stable lookup key.
- `providers`: nodes that can serve the artifact, represented as `P2pPeer` values.
- `backend_locator`: optional transport-specific string used only by the matching backend. For iroh this is the `iroh-blobs` hash.
- `metadata`: module-defined JSON used by callers to interpret the file.

`P2pPublishRequest` wraps a stable key, a local source path or in-memory bytes, optional metadata, and a `P2pPublishMode`. `P2pPublishRequest::file(key, source)` defaults metadata to `null` and publish mode to `Copy`; `P2pPublishRequest::bytes(key, bytes)` publishes already-buffered bytes. `Copy` allows the transport to copy bytes into its own store; `Reference` lets backends retain or index the existing file when supported.

## Disabled Transport

`DisabledP2pTransport` is selected when `[p2p].enabled = false` or `transport = "disabled"`.

- `lookup` returns `Ok(None)`.
- `publish` succeeds as a no-op.
- `unpublish` succeeds as a no-op and returns `Ok(false)`.
- `fetch` returns `TransportDisabled`.
- `local_endpoint` returns `None`.

This lets consumers call the P2P layer unconditionally while keeping default deployments unchanged.

## Iroh Backend

`IrohBlobsP2pTransport` is selected with `[p2p].enabled = true` and `[p2p].transport = "iroh"`.

At startup it:

1. Creates the configured blob store directory.
2. Opens an `iroh_blobs::store::fs::FsStore` with gated background GC.
3. Opens a RocksDB-backed local catalog at `<p2p.store_dir>/iroh/catalog.db`.
4. Binds an `iroh` endpoint, optionally using `[p2p].listen_addr`.
5. Starts one router that serves both `iroh-blobs` data and AgentENV's catalog protocol.
6. Publishes the local endpoint through `local_endpoint()` so observability heartbeat can advertise it.

The backend uses one local catalog:

- Published catalog: artifact key to the descriptor this node can serve. The in-memory map is loaded from RocksDB on startup; each RocksDB value is a compact JSON descriptor.

Lookup first checks the local published catalog, then asks scheduler for nodes indexed under the artifact key, and finally falls back to discovered peers over the AgentENV catalog ALPN in hint/discovery order. Scheduler-indexed and fallback candidates are still verified by querying each node's catalog; scheduler never stores locators or metadata. The descriptor carries the iroh blob hash in its backend locator, so `fetch` does not depend on prior in-process lookup state.

Fetch parses the descriptor's backend locator as an iroh blob hash, passes all descriptor providers to `iroh-blobs`, downloads that blob into the local `FsStore`, and exports it to the requested destination. Iroh's content-addressed blob transfer validates bytes against that hash. If any descriptor provider is local node, fetch exports directly from the local store.

After a remote fetch downloads the blob into the local store, the iroh backend best-effort advertises the local copy. It applies the same deterministic retention tag used by publish, builds a descriptor with this node as the only local catalog provider, upserts that descriptor into the local catalog, and records the key in scheduler. This makes the fetching node a provider for later peers and lets artifacts spread through the cluster. Advertisement or scheduler-index failures are logged and do not fail `fetch`; only the download and destination export are part of the required fetch result.

Publish imports the local file into `FsStore`, applies a deterministic named tag derived from the artifact key (`agentenv:p2p:v1:{sha256(key)}`), builds a descriptor with this node as the only local catalog provider, local endpoint, iroh blob hash locator, and request metadata, upserts that descriptor into the local catalog, and best-effort records the key in scheduler.

Unpublish removes the key from the local catalog, deletes the deterministic named tag, forgets the key in scheduler, persists the catalog, and returns whether a local publication was removed. Deleting the tag stops future catalog lookup immediately, but it does not synchronously delete the blob bytes. The iroh store reclaims untagged blobs through its GC.

GC is gated to avoid periodic full-store scans when there is no known deletion work:

- The transport starts with one pending GC pass, so a restart can clean up blobs whose tags were removed before a previous process exited.
- `unpublish` marks GC as pending after deleting the retention tag.
- Each GC interval wakes up the iroh-blobs GC task, but the configured `add_protected` callback aborts the mark/sweep pass unless pending GC is set.
- When pending GC is set, one full mark/sweep pass runs. It preserves tagged and temp-tagged blobs and deletes blobs that are no longer protected.

## Scheduler Discovery And Artifact Index

The scheduler is a directory for node endpoints and artifact-to-node hints only.

1. AgentENV starts the configured P2P transport in `src/bin/server.rs`.
2. If the transport exposes `local_endpoint()`, `ObservabilityReporter` includes it in heartbeat requests.
3. Scheduler stores the endpoint with the observed-node record.
4. `SchedulerPeerDiscovery` periodically calls `ListP2pPeers(cluster_id, backend, exclude_node_id)`.
5. Scheduler returns ready nodes with non-empty endpoints for the requested backend.
6. The transport dials peers directly for catalog lookup and byte transfer.

For artifact lookup acceleration, the iroh backend also calls:

- `RecordP2pArtifact(cluster_id, backend, key, node_id)` after publish and after successful remote fetch advertisement.
- `ForgetP2pArtifact(cluster_id, backend, key, node_id)` after local unpublish.
- `LookupP2pArtifact(cluster_id, backend, key, exclude_node_id)` before broad peer polling.

Scheduler keeps this artifact index in memory and stores only key-to-node mappings. Lookup responses are filtered through the same ready-node and backend endpoint checks as `ListP2pPeers`. Node unregister removes all artifact mappings for that node. Scheduler does not persist artifact catalogs, inspect artifact metadata or locators, or proxy bytes.

## Snapshot And Overlaybd Consumers

`src/snapshot/p2p.rs` is the snapshot-store integration layer. It is intentionally small: the snapshot manager publishes artifacts after the configured repository commit succeeds, and runtime resolvers treat P2P as an optional acceleration path rather than committed truth.

Snapshot publication advertises:

- Fixed Firecracker artifacts under `snapshot/v1/artifacts/{snapshot_id}/{relative_path}`:
  - `vm_state.bin` is published from its local file path.
  - `firecracker-manifest.json` is serialized from the committed manifest and published as bytes.
- Overlaybd layers referenced by the snapshot's rootfs, memory, and attached-drive image configs. These are not published under a snapshot-specific key. They reuse the overlaybd layer artifact protocol owned by `src/overlaybd/p2p/artifact.rs`, with keys like `overlaybd-layer/v1/sha256:<digest>` and `LayerMetadata` understood by the overlaybd HTTP facade.

That split is important. Snapshot fixed artifacts are scoped to one snapshot ID and are only consumed by snapshot runtime resolvers. Overlaybd commit layers are content-addressed and may be consumed by any overlaybd runtime path, including foreground range reads through `/p2p-http/{origin}`. Do not add a second snapshot-specific key format for overlaybd layers; doing so publishes bytes that overlaybd cannot discover.

OSS snapshot resolution consumes fixed artifacts through P2P first:

- `vm_state.bin` is fetched into the node-local `LocalArtifactCache` from P2P, falling back to OSS on miss or fetch failure.
- `firecracker-manifest.json` is fetched with `fetch_bytes` from P2P, parsed in memory, and falls back to OSS on miss, fetch failure, or parse failure.

POSIX snapshot resolution does not consume P2P. A POSIX repository is already a directly accessible committed artifact store; if a required file is missing, the resolver returns `ArtifactNotFound` instead of repairing the repository from peers. Overlaybd layer acceleration for runtime block reads remains the responsibility of the overlaybd P2P facade, not the POSIX snapshot resolver.

Snapshot P2P publish is best-effort. A failed P2P publish logs a warning and does not roll back the committed snapshot record. This preserves the repository as the source of truth while making newly published artifacts visible to peers before slower backend downloads or uploads become the bottleneck.

## Integrity And Ownership

The P2P transport does not define what an artifact means. Each consuming module owns:

- Constructing stable keys.
- Writing metadata into publish requests.
- Validating metadata before trusting a fetched artifact.
- Deciding whether and when to publish local artifacts.

This boundary keeps the transport reusable and avoids baking module-specific cache semantics into `src/p2p`.
