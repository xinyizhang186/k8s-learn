# Cube Sandbox Dev Environment

[中文文档](README_zh.md)

> A throwaway VM for hacking on Cube Sandbox without touching your host.

## What is this

A set of shell scripts that spin up a disposable `OpenCloudOS 9` VM on your
Linux host, with SSH and the Cube API port-forwarded back to localhost:

```text
SSH      : 127.0.0.1:10022 -> guest:22
Cube API : 127.0.0.1:13000 -> guest:3000
Cube HTTP: 127.0.0.1:11080 -> guest:80
Cube TLS : 127.0.0.1:11443 -> guest:443
WebUI    : 127.0.0.1:12088 -> guest:12088
```

Use this when you want to:

- Try Cube Sandbox end-to-end on a Linux laptop without polluting your host
- Iterate on the source code in this repo and see your changes running
  inside a real Cube Sandbox installation

**Do not use this as a production deployment**. For production, see
[`deploy/one-click/`](../deploy/one-click/).

## Prerequisites

- Linux x86_64 host with KVM enabled (`/dev/kvm` exists)
- Nested virtualization enabled on the host (Cube Sandbox runs MicroVMs
  inside the guest, so the guest needs `/dev/kvm` too)
- Host packages: `qemu-system-x86_64`, `qemu-img`, `curl`, `ssh`, `scp`,
  `setsid`, `python3`, `rg`

Quick sanity check:

```bash
ls -l /dev/kvm
cat /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested   # or kvm_amd, expect Y / 1
```

## Quickstart

Five steps. Run them in order.

### Step 1 &nbsp; Prepare the VM image &nbsp; *(one-off, ~10 min)*

```bash
./prepare_image.sh
```

Downloads the OpenCloudOS 9 cloud image, resizes it to 100G, and runs
the in-guest setup (grow rootfs, relax SELinux, fix PATH, install login
banner, install the autostart systemd unit). When it finishes the VM is
shut down.

You only need this on first setup or after deleting `.workdir/`.

### Step 2 &nbsp; Boot the VM &nbsp; *(terminal A)*

```bash
./run_vm.sh
```

QEMU's serial console stays attached to this terminal. Do not quit QEMU
with `Ctrl+a` then `x`; that is abrupt and can corrupt the guest. In
another terminal run `./login.sh`, then run `poweroff` inside the guest.
After the guest shuts down, `run_vm.sh` in this terminal usually exits on
its own.

### Step 3 &nbsp; Log in &nbsp; *(terminal B)*

```bash
./login.sh
```

You land in a root shell inside the guest. Password handling is
automated.

### Step 4 &nbsp; Install Cube Sandbox inside the VM &nbsp; *(once per fresh VM)*

Inside the guest shell from Step 3:

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/tencentcloud/CubeSandbox/raw/master/deploy/one-click/online-install.sh | bash
```

When this finishes you should see the four core processes alive
(`network-agent`, `cubemaster`, `cube-api`, `cubelet`).

### Step 5 &nbsp; Verify &nbsp; *(inside the VM)*

```bash
curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:3000/health && echo OK
```

You should see `OK`. Cube Sandbox is now running.

## Make it survive a reboot &nbsp; *(one-off, strongly recommended)*

By default the cube components are launched as bare processes — they do
**not** come back after the VM reboots. To let `systemd` bring them up
on every boot, run **on the host** after Step 5:

```bash
./cube-autostart.sh            # default subcommand: enable
```

This asks for confirmation, then enables `cube-sandbox-oneclick.service`
inside the guest. From now on every boot will run `up-with-deps.sh`,
which brings MySQL/Redis, cube-proxy, coredns, network-agent,
cubemaster, cube-api and cubelet up together.

Other subcommands:

```bash
./cube-autostart.sh status     # show is-enabled / is-active
./cube-autostart.sh disable    # roll back
```

## Develop: edit code, push to VM, see results

This is the main reason `dev-env/` exists.

Recommended terminal setup:

```bash
./login.sh    # keep this shell open; by default it lands in a root shell
```

Then iterate from your host shell:

```bash
make all
./sync_to_vm.sh bin cubelet cubemaster
```

`sync_to_vm.sh` now has a single job: copy files into the VM. It does not
build on the host, restart services, run `quickcheck.sh`, or roll back
automatically.

After the copy finishes, paste the printed restart command into your
`./login.sh` session:

```bash
systemctl restart cube-sandbox-oneclick.service
```

Useful examples:

```bash
# Sync all known binaries from _output/bin/
./sync_to_vm.sh bin

# Sync only specific components
./sync_to_vm.sh bin cubemaster cubelet

# Push arbitrary files into the guest
./sync_to_vm.sh files --remote-dir /tmp ./configs/foo.toml

# Build and deploy the WebUI into the guest
make -C .. web-sync-dev-env
```

The previous binary is still kept on the VM as `*.bak`, but the script no
longer surfaces rollback or verification steps in its output.

Prerequisite: Step 4 finished and (recommended) `./cube-autostart.sh`
has been run.

## Manual release flow

From your host shell:

```bash
make manual-release
./sync_to_vm.sh files \
  _output/release/cube-manual-update-*.tar.gz \
  deploy/one-click/deploy-manual.sh
```

Then in your `./login.sh` session:

```bash
bash /tmp/deploy-manual.sh /tmp/cube-manual-update-*.tar.gz
```

## Collect logs from the VM

```bash
./copy_logs.sh
```

Tarballs `/data/log` from inside the guest and drops it next to this
README as `data-log-<timestamp>.tar.gz`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| No `/dev/kvm` inside the guest | Nested KVM disabled on the host | Enable nested virtualization on the host, then reboot the VM |
| `./login.sh` fails to connect | VM not booted yet, or host port 10022 is busy | Check that `./run_vm.sh` is still running, or set `SSH_PORT` |
| `df -h /` inside the guest is still small | `prepare_image.sh` never finished the auto-grow step | Inspect `.workdir/qemu-serial.log`, then `scp internal/grow_rootfs.sh` into the guest and run it manually |
| Host port 13000 / 11080 / 11443 / 12088 already taken | Some other service binds the forwarded dev-env ports | Start with `CUBE_API_PORT=23000 CUBE_PROXY_HTTP_PORT=21080 CUBE_PROXY_HTTPS_PORT=21443 WEB_UI_PORT=22088 ./run_vm.sh` |
| Cube components gone after VM reboot | Autostart not enabled | Run `./cube-autostart.sh` once |
| New binaries fail after restart | The new build is bad, or `quickcheck` fails when you run it manually | Check `/data/log/` in the guest, and if needed restore the previous `*.bak` binary manually before restarting again |
